### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a business dedicated to offering household games like "Draw It Or Lose It" across all platforms. They sought to extend this experience to all devices through a web-based application. The software project entailed rendering stock images, implementing timing and round systems, incorporating a unique team and player system with distinct names, and developing an intricate game management system. As stated before, they wanted me to make a web-based application that is easily accessible to all major platforms and devices.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe my ability in determining requirements and crafting a robust UML Class Diagram stands out in the development process. Emphasizing architecture is really important in my eyes so I try to focus on the architecture of the project as best as I could. Architecture is very important in any project, in the case where a project is planned poorly, or not planned at all, the entire project can enter Development Hell and crumble on itself.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I believe that the process of working through a design document was very helpful in developing code. Having a clear roadmap aided in knowing what to implement, resulting in a smoother engineering experience. To sum it up, it was very easy to know what to implement.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Personally, if I were to revise a part of my work it would be the Business Requirements or the Recommendations sections. I feel that my Business Requirements weren't as in-depth as they could of been and definitely were slacking in clarity, ,y Recommendations had a similar problem but instead it was too verbose and confusing for any nontechnical audience to understand. 

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Understanding and addressing user needs were very important to me, I interpreted their needs by thinking about how I could streamline the experience for them while introducing innovation. Considering user needs is critical because they are the ultimate clients of any project. 

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software by prioritizing both client and user perspectives, I also spent time iterating between business and software requirements to develop a balanced solution. I plan to continue implementing learned techniques such as thorough note-taking during client interactions and maintaining clear communication channels. I aim to create my own Software Design Document for larger projects with clients to enhance clarity and alignment throughout the development process.
